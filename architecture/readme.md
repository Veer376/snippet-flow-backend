Hi!

There is a change, we will be moving with the pgvector instead of opensearch, to save cost in the development.
Later i will try to use the opensearch for the fast retrieval.


# Building protoype.
1. pgvector for the embeddings.
2. numpy for the generated dummy embeddings.
3. with this we will have the snippet_route, having /save, /rating, /get endpoints working with us.
4. Also we are looking forward to have the event-driven architecture for saving the snippets embeddings in pgvector, lets see how it goes.
5.
